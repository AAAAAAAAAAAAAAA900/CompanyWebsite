                    'Photo King: Image Sharing Game' is a social media 
                    app built in react native and spring boot. It 
                    allows users to create accounts, add friends, invite 
                    friends to groups, share photos, and rank photos to 
                    crown a photo king. Groups reset every week and assign 
                    the top 3 placing image posters points tracked on 
                    the group members bar. Additional features include 
                    profile customization, image comment sections, AI 
                    image filtering using OpenAI's moderation API, 
                    blocking users, and reporting photos/comments.
